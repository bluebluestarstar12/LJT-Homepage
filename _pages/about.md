I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate at the HKUST NLP Group, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Junxian He, who also guided me during my undergraduate studies at SJTU. My research interests lie in the truthfulness and reasoning capabilities of large language models. Specifically, I am interested in:
* LLM Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning
* Hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLM)
* LLM truthfulness and Interpretability

Education
======
* **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, 2024 - Present
  * Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
* **B.Eng. in Computer Science**, 2020 - 2024
  * Shanghai Jiao Tong University

Research Experience
======
* **Research Intern**, MINIMAX, Feb 2025 - Present
* **Research Intern**, Tencent WXG, June 2024 - Sept 2024
  * Advised by Zifei Shan
